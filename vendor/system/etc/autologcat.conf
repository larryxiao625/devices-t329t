# You may change this command to your preference. The default filters on ADM and MLR logs and logs to SDcard.
# The logcat options that can be used are:
# -r - Rotates the log file every <kbytes> of output. The default value is 16. Requires the -f option.
# -n - Sets the maximum number of rotated logs. The default i 4.
# -v - Sets the output format for log messages. The default is brief  format.
# -f - Writes log message output to <filename>. The default is stdout.
#
# Filter example below:
# <logcat command> [OPTIONS] [LOGPATH] ADM:V MLR:W *:S - Filter expression that suppresses all log messages except those with the tag "ADM",
# at priority "Verbose" (highest priority) and "MLR", at priority "Warning" and above.
# The priority is one of the following character values, ordered from lowest to highest priority:
#    * V - Verbose (lowest priority)
#    * D - Debug
#    * I - Info
#    * W - Warning
#    * E - Error
#    * F - Fatal
